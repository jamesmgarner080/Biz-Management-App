## 🔑 Feature 1: User Creation with Permission Assignment

   - Select additional permissions beyond role defaults
   - Permissions are granted immediately upon user creation

5. **Click Save User**
   - User is created with selected role
   - Custom permissions are automatically granted
   - User can login and access assigned features

### Navigation Access for Admin

**Admin sees ALL navigation items:**

- ✅ Notifications
- ✅ **Reports** (all report types)
- ✅ **Users** (create, edit, manage)
- ✅ **Permissions** (assign, revoke)
- ✅ Settings

### Permission-Based Access Control

**How It Works:**
1. Admin role has ALL permissions by default
2. Other roles have role-based permissions
3. Custom permissions can be added to any user
4. System checks permissions before allowing actions
5. Admin bypasses all permission checks

**Backend Enforcement:**
```javascript
// Admin always has access
if (user.role === 'admin') {
    // Allow all operations
}

// Others need specific permissions
if (!hasPermission(user.id, 'create_tasks')) {
    // Deny access
}
```
