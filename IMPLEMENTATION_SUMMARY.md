# Implementation Summary - Test Database & Role Fix

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Kerry's Role Issue
**Problem:** User "Kerry Young" was created with admin role instead of bar_staff role.

- Confirmed role can be edited by admin/manager users
- Role changes take effect immediately upon login

**Verification:**
```sql
SELECT id, username, role, full_name FROM users WHERE username = 'Kerry';
-- Result: 3|Kerry|bar_staff|Kerry Young
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Changes:
1. Backed up original database to `business_management.db.backup`
2. Updated Kerry's role: `UPDATE users SET role = 'bar_staff' WHERE username = 'Kerry'`
3. Cleared existing test data (preserved admin user)
4. Inserted 15 new test users with bcrypt-hashed passwords
5. Created 33 realistic tasks with proper assignments
6. Added 18 shift schedules across next week

### Password Hashing:
- All test users use bcrypt hash: `$2b$10$sZ0ml5ADv1cso23C38zvC.f0eYFViA6sm56oscb0yeQgxB.AvWShG`
- Corresponds to password: `password123`
- 10 rounds of bcrypt for security

### Server Status:
- ✅ Server restarted successfully
- ✅ Database loaded with test data
- ✅ Port 3000 exposed and accessible
- ✅ All features operational

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

2. Go to Users → Find Kerry → Verify role is "Bar Staff"
3. Edit Kerry's role to "Manager" → Save
4. Edit Kerry's role back to "Bar Staff" → Save
5. Logout and login as Kerry (Kerry/password123)
6. Verify Kerry only sees bar staff features

### Comprehensive Test (20 minutes):
